                It is efficient, scalable, flexible and accurate.
                It can be used for a wide range of applications. 
                It is sensitive to initial configurations, 
                number of clusters, and various other factors 
                which need to be taken into consideration when using

                Web development is the work involved in developing a 
                website for the Internet. Web development 
                can range from developing a simple single static page of 
                plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, 
                and social network services. A more comprehensive list of 
                tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include 
                web engineering, web design, web content development, 
                client-side/server-side scripting, web server and 
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</big></td>

                It is a text-Based Maze Navigation Game Introduction: 
                "Code Cab" is a text-based maze navigation game 
                where the player controls a taxi represented by '@' 
                symbol. The objective is to navigate through a maze, 
                avoid obstacles represented by 'X' symbols, and reach 
                the passenger represented by '#' symbol in as few steps 
                as possible.

                It represents the maze as a graph with nodes and 
                edges. Helps in pathfinding using Breadth-First 
                Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path 
                between the taxi and the passenger. Manages maze 
                connections by creating edges between valid cells.</big></td>
